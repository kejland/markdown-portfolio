# My Markdown Port

Hi! My name is Eun Jin, and this is my Markdown Portfolio [(=^･ω･^=)](https://github.com/kejland)

**Here is a random list of things that I like:**
- Ice cream
- Cake
- Barley Tea
- Omija Sangria Tea

**If I had to order them from best to worst, it would be:**
1. Barley Tea
2. Ice cream
3. Cake
4. Barley Tea

```

Although barley tea may not sound very exciting, I consider it to be water.
And I cannot survive without water, therefore making it number 1.

**Here is a random table rating the Haagen Daz ice cream flavours that I have tried:**
